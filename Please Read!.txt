I have added a branch for each of us to make changes on, The branches should be selectable near the top of the github software, a small drop down list that will most like say Master to begin with, click that and change it to your username, then publish changes to that branch, In this way no one will overwrite each others changes, and when we are ready we can merge the changes together onto the master branch.
