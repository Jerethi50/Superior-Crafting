============
This mod is based off of the mod Quarry By ominus, I took his mod and changed the functionality,
Now at the begining of a new game silver, mineral, stone and uranium Meteorites will spawn on the planets surface, 
In varying abundances, based on mineral type and rarity, 
I also adjusted the health of each type of Meteorite based on realistic mineral hardness values.
I removed the original functionality of the quarry mod, and changed the id's used, 
So this should be compatible with the original mod if it is ever updated.

Original Readme:

This mod allows you to dig up stone and minerals on rock terrain, 
it takes longer to dig/mine the minerals that are more valuable.
 
 Initially this mod was meant to provide a slow but infinite way of getting stone 
 but then i decided to add a few more choices for mining.
